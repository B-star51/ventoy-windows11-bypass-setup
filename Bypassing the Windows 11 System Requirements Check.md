Bypassing the Windows 11 System Requirements Check Using Ventoy
For a long time, I assumed "Windows 11 bypass" referred to some untrustworthy method of installing the operating system. I never looked further into it until recently, when curiosity led me to discover that it simply refers to bypassing the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) check — nothing more. Importantly, even with this bypass, you’ll still receive official Windows 11 updates, making this method both useful and legitimate.

I personally recommend using Ventoy to create bootable USB drives. I’ve had a consistently reliable experience with it.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Download Ventoy from the official site:
https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html
Install it and create a bootable USB drive.

Download the official Windows 11 ISO from Microsoft:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11

Copy the ISO to the USB drive that you prepared using Ventoy.

Enable the Windows 11 Bypass Plugin:

Create a folder named /ventoy in the root directory of the first partition of your USB drive (this is the partition where the ISO files are stored, not the small 32MB VTOYEFI partition).

Inside the /ventoy folder, create a file named ventoy.json.

Add the following content to the ventoy.json file:


{
  "control": [
    { "VTOY_WIN11_BYPASS_CHECK": "1" }
  ]
}
Save the file.

Once this setup is complete, your USB drive will allow you to install Windows 11 without enforcing the TPM, Secure Boot, or RAM checks. I have personally tested this method, and it works effectively while still allowing regular Windows updates.
